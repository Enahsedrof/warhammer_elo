ELO calculator (for warhammer)

** Inspired by this site ** http://aligulac.com/
This is very extensive but I would like to build from the ground up a similiar platform but for competitive tabletop gaming,
Very simply I will make up a handful of players and record fake matches to track their rating.
Once I have achieved that I will get the programming done and push out the frontend.
Finishing that I will then scale it up with real tournaments and people. (This is also a personal project so will be done even after the acad)
There is a website with results and look to pull results from that site.
Scale it up and record several years worth of data
Cry in sleep after that part is finished.

SQL database
- players and game results
- updates ELO based on results added
- run on Google cloud
- Start small and then worry about upscaling and adding features like recorded events and Faction played

HTML
- table showing ELO
- Compares 2 players and predicted result
- Allows matches to be entered??
-

Python
- runs the site
- implement results into DB
